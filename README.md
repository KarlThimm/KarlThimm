My name is Karl Thimm and I am a senior computer engineering student at the University of Delaware.
My goal is to become a software engineer/developer after college.
The repositories on this account consist of school assignments/projects and as well as side projects I created myself.
Some of the programs written in C need a microcontrtoller to run such as the Bulls and Cows game. 
More side projects and coding challenges to come.
Resides in Westchester County New York.
